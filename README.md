# Path Tracing in Ada 2023

## Project Overview
Path tracing is a Monte Carlo rendering algorithm introduced by James Kajiya in 1986 to solve the rendering equation. It simulates the physical transport of light by tracing stochastic ray paths backward from the camera into the scene. This Ada 2023 implementation provides a strongly typed, zero-warning implementation of the algorithm with three distinct integration variants: Pure Monte Carlo Path Tracing, Next Event Estimation (explicit light source sampling), and Russian Roulette stochastic termination.

## Features
* Pure Monte Carlo Path Tracing: Unbiased path expansion with diffuse cosine-weighted hemispherical sampling and specular reflection.
* Next Event Estimation (NEE): Direct illumination sampling at each bounce to accelerate radiance convergence.
* Russian Roulette Termination: Unbiased probabilistic ray termination based on surface reflectance throughput.
* Analytical Sphere Ray Tracing: Exact algebraic quadric intersections with surface normal derivation.
* Strong Typing: Custom types for Vector_3D, Radiance, Color_RGB, Ray, Material, and Sphere.
* Contract-Driven: Preconditions and invariants annotating all core geometric and radiometric subprograms.

## Testing
The test suite in tests.adb covers four main verification and validation categories:
* Geometric and radiometric calculations: Vector operations (addition, subtraction, scaling, cross/dot product), vector normalization, specular reflection vectors, and cosine-weighted hemispherical distributions to guarantee physical plausibility.
* Error handling and defensive programming: Verification that Degenerate_Vector_Error is raised on zero-length normalization and division by zero.
* Intersection invariants: Analytical ray-sphere intersection correctness, distance ordering, and proper foreground-to-background occlusion in multi-object environments.
* Radiometric integration correctness: Pure path direct emitter evaluation, shadow ray transmission for Next Event Estimation, and probabilistic unbiased termination with Russian Roulette.

## Building
* Compiler: GNAT toolchain supporting ISO/IEC 8652:2023 (compiled with -gnat2022 and -gnatwa).
* Build tool: GNU Make.

Command references:
* make: Compiles tests.adb to bin/tests via GNAT project management.
* make test: Executes the complete test harness.
* make clean: Deletes the obj/ and bin/ directories.
